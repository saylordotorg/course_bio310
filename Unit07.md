**Unit 7: Very Late - And Post Embryonic Development** <span
id="7"></span> 
*We have not yet covered one type of development that is extremely
important for creating the next generation: the differentiation of sexes
and the development of sexual characteristics and organs.  This process
is known as sex determination, and, depending on the organisms involved,
it can be determined or influenced by environmental as well as genetic
factors.*  
  
 *Although the most dramatic types of development have already occurred
in most organisms during their time as embryos, development itself does
not necessarily end once organisms are hatched, born, or otherwise
recognized as being fully-formed, independent creatures.  Some very
important changes in physiology and morphology can occur on the way
to—or even during—adulthood.  These changes include both
metamorphosis—one of the most comprehensive reorganizations of tissues
and structures possible—and regeneration.*

**Unit7 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Answer questions about the various types of sex determination and
    development (chromosomal, environmental), including which organisms
    use which type of development and what chemicals, genes, proteins,
    and environmental cues affect these types of development.
-   Distinguish between different types of metamorphosis and
    regeneration; identify which groups of organisms use them; and
    answer questions about the molecules, genes, and structures involved
    in these processes.

**7.1.3 Unusual Sex Determination** <span id="7.1.3"></span> 
*Note: A small number of organisms in a variety of different phyla
exhibit what we would consider to be uncharacteristic sex development or
sexual systems: some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites; some
change sex from male to female or female to male or back and forth;
some, like peppermint shrimp, change sex from being male to being
simultaneous hermaphrodites!  The molecular mechanisms and environmental
influences behind these developmental changes are not always understood,
but these sexual systems, and their potential adaptive benefits, are
currently areas of considerable research interest.*

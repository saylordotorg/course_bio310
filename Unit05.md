title: "BIO310: Developmental Biology"
course_description: "A survey of the field of developmental biology from its origins to the present day, from seminal historical experiments to modern techniques and the mechanisms of development. Follows a variety of organisms from their start at fertilization through the stages of their development and on to entire organismal and post-embryonic development, as well as the molecular and genetic regulations involved in these processes."

**Unit 5: Axis Formation** <span id="5"></span> 
*All eggs have essentially radial symmetry, but most animals exhibit at
least some bilateral symmetry: differences in their right and left
sides, their anterior and posterior ends, as well as their dorsal and
ventral surfaces.  How are these patterns created?  They are the result
of a complex series of processes that specify which cells will be in
which part of the embryo and that in turn guarantee that the organism’s
heart will be in the right place—literally.  In this unit, you will
focus on axis formation in two model systems: an invertebrate (the
fruit-fly, or Drosophila spp.) and a vertebrate (the frog).  These
organisms have been studied extensively, and the molecular mechanisms of
their axis formation are relatively well understood.  They will
accordingly serve as excellent illustrations of the complex processes
involved in this aspect of development.*

**Unit5 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Demonstrate an understanding of the importance and role of the
    Organizer in axis formation and patterning.
-   Recognize and identify some of the major genes and proteins involved
    in various types of axis formation.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the steps of the gastrulation
    process and the roles of major genes and proteins in that process.

**Unit 4: Gastrulation** <span id="4"></span> 
*Once the embryo has become multicellular, it must begin to organize
itself and develop germ layers, which are cell layers that will have
very different fates and functions as the embryo develops.  These germ
layers must also be rearranged to allow for appropriate cell
interactions and to ensure that their positions will correspond with the
areas where the tissues and organs that they will give rise to will
form.  This process involves many cell movements, and, as with cleavage,
although many of the movements are shared among different species, the
process of gastrulation itself differs in different kinds of embryos.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Identify the types of cell movements involved in gastrulation.
-   Demonstrate an understanding the steps of the gastrulation process
    and what effect the presence or absence of specific molecules and
    structures have on that process.
-   Distinguish between germ layers and demonstrate an understanding of
    what tissues/organs develop from each layer.

*Note: The three types of germ layers listed in this subunit are in
order from the outermost layer to the innermost layer.  Please note that
some groups of organisms, such as sponges and cnidarians (jellyfish,
anemones, and corals) have only two germ layers, the ectoderm and
endoderm, and are referred to as “diploblastic;” those with three germ
layers are referred to as “triploblastic.”*

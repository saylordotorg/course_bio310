title: "BIO310: Developmental Biology"
course_description: "A survey of the field of developmental biology from its origins to the present day, from seminal historical experiments to modern techniques and the mechanisms of development. Follows a variety of organisms from their start at fertilization through the stages of their development and on to entire organismal and post-embryonic development, as well as the molecular and genetic regulations involved in these processes."

**Unit 9: “Eco-Devo”: Environmental Influences on Development** <span
id="9"></span> 
*All environments influence development; genes may be the same in two
eggs, but differences in their cytoplasmic environments can affect them
diversely; variations in temperature can influence the sex of turtles
and other reptiles; multifarious environmental conditions can induce
faster or slower development or stimulate the development of various
adaptive traits.  Environmental influences are a natural part of
development, but these influences can have normal or disruptive effects
on organisms, depending on whether or not the environment itself has
been disrupted. *  
  
 *In this unit, we will explore both natural and unnatural effects of
the environment on development.  As with “evo-devo,” this field is an
area of current interest as researchers become more involved in
integrating biological disciplines and in determining the effects of
drugs and pollutants, among other factors, on the development of human
and non-human organisms.*

**Unit9 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Answer questions about the effects of various natural environmental
    factors on development (e.g. timing of development, sex change
    differentiation or change, different developmental forms).
-   Answer questions about the effects of various unnatural
    environmental factors on development (e.g. interrupting/altering
    sexual development, limb development, mental development).

title: "BIO310: Developmental Biology"
course_description: "A survey of the field of developmental biology from its origins to the present day, from seminal historical experiments to modern techniques and the mechanisms of development. Follows a variety of organisms from their start at fertilization through the stages of their development and on to entire organismal and post-embryonic development, as well as the molecular and genetic regulations involved in these processes."

**Unit 6: Later Embryonic Development** <span id="6"></span> 
*Once germ layers have been formed and patterning has begun, the embryo
can begin to develop those complex tissues and organs it will need for
adult life.  This unit will detail the formation of tissues and organs
arising from each of the three germ layers. You will learn that each
germ layer gives rise to very specific structures.*

**Unit6 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Identify which later tissues and structures arise from which germ
    layers and early-embryonic structures.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the processes of later development,
    especially limb development, and the roles of specific genes,
    molecules, and tissue areas in these processes.

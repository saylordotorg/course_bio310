title: "BIO310: Developmental Biology"
course_description: "A survey of the field of developmental biology from its origins to the present day, from seminal historical experiments to modern techniques and the mechanisms of development. Follows a variety of organisms from their start at fertilization through the stages of their development and on to entire organismal and post-embryonic development, as well as the molecular and genetic regulations involved in these processes."

**Unit 8: "Evo-Devo": Evolutionary and Developmental Biology** <span
id="8"></span> 
*Do all organisms share common ancestors?  Why are there so many kinds
of organisms?  Why are there not more kinds of organisms?  Do we have
traits in common with other closely related species, or even with very
distantly related species?  How did dramatic evolutionary changes
occur?*  
 *            
 Developmental biology can help us answer many basic evolutionary
questions.  In fact, developmental evidence has provided support for
Darwin’s theory of evolution and in fact continues to illuminate some of
the practical questions involved.  The developmental similarities
animals share, from the “housekeeping” genes we have in common with
fruit-flies to the homologous limb structures we share with all other
vertebrates, demonstrate our relatedness.  The mechanisms through which
developmental changes occur give us an idea of how even minor
alterations in gene patterning during development could lead to the
expression of very different traits for natural selection to act on. 
The practical constraints on development explain why there are
restrictions on the amount of evolutionary variation that can exist. 
The combination of insights in evolutionary biology and developmental
biology can help us answer questions in both fields.*

**Unit8 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Answer questions about the evidence developmental biology has
    provided for evolution and how various evolutionary processes came
    about.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the function of HOX genes and their
    importance in evolutionary processes.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of developmental constraints as they
    relate to what evolutionary adaptations/changes are possible.
-   Demonstrate an understanding of the role that modularity had played
    in evolution.

title: "BIO310: Developmental Biology"
course_description: "A survey of the field of developmental biology from its origins to the present day, from seminal historical experiments to modern techniques and the mechanisms of development. Follows a variety of organisms from their start at fertilization through the stages of their development and on to entire organismal and post-embryonic development, as well as the molecular and genetic regulations involved in these processes."

**Unit 2: Genes and Development** <span id="2"></span> 
*Before you continue to follow the process of development in a newly
fertilized egg, it is important to learn about another fundamental
aspect of development: the role that genes play in determining cells’
behaviors and fates.  After all, every cell has the same genes as any
other cell; how, then, do these cells differentiate and lead to the
development of entirely different, complex structures? The answer is:
through differential gene expression.  The expression and transmission
of genes has been a part of developmental biology from the start.  This
unit will describe the first discoveries of genetic expression and
transmission in embryos, the molecular basis for this regulation of
expression, and the current molecular techniques used by developmental
biologists to determine what genes are expressed and where.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Answer basic questions about the regulation of gene expression
    (pre-transcription through post-translation).
-   Demonstrate their understanding of the molecular techniques used in
    developmental biology by identifying the most appropriate technique
    to use to answer a given question.

*Note: As you learn about the genes involved in development, remember
that many genes are named for the traits of individuals with their
mutations; “wingless,” for example, is not a gene for winglessness, but
organisms with defective copies of this gene will have no wings or
defective wings.  Genes are not named this way in order to confuse
students, although it may sometimes seem like it; rather, they are given
these names because often the only or best way to determine which genes
are necessary for specific aspects of development is to inactivate them
and see how the embryo develops in their absence.*

**Unit 1: Beginnings** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce you to the field of developmental biology,
including some of its most fundamental preoccupations, its early
history, and our current understanding of the beginning of development
itself: gametogenesis and fertilization.*

**Unit1 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:

-   Identify a few major figures in the development of the field.
-   Answer questions about the field and how researchers’ understanding
    of development have changed over time.
-   Answer questions about the structure of sperm and eggs.
-   Demonstrate their understanding of the process of fertilization
    (including recognition, binding, fusion, and the activation of egg
    metabolism) and the roles of various molecules in that process.

     Instructions: Watch Lecture 19 (“Steps in Development”); although
    the details of developmental processes will be unfamiliar to you
    until later in this course, this lecture will provide you with a
    good overview of the field of developmental biology and the areas of
    study within it.  This lecture will cover the entirety of Unit 1.
